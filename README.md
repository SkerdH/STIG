# STIG Compliance Implementation  

This section contains **Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)** that I have successfully implemented to enhance system security and ensure compliance with industry standards.  

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose  
STIGs are essential for **hardening IT systems** by addressing security vulnerabilities and enforcing best practices. The configurations in this section align with **Department of Defense (DoD), NIST 800-53, GDPR, HIPAA, and other cybersecurity frameworks** to improve system resilience against threats.  

By implementing these STIGs, I aim to:  
- Reduce security risks by enforcing strict configuration policies.  
- Ensure compliance with regulatory and organizational security requirements.  
- Automate security configurations using **PowerShell and other scripting tools**.  
- Maintain a structured approach to securing **Windows, Linux, and cloud environments**.  

## âœ… Completed STIGs  
This repository will be continuously updated with completed STIG implementations, covering areas such as:  
- **System Logging & Auditing**  
- **User Access & Identity Management**  
- **Network Security & Firewall Hardening**  
- **Cloud Security & Compliance Configurations**  

Each configuration ensures that systems meet the required security standards while maintaining operational efficiency.  

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue securing and optimizing IT environments! ðŸš€
